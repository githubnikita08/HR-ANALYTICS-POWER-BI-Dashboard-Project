This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition within an organization, utilizing an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard built in Power BI. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key factors contributing to employee turnover, including demographic, educational, and job role-specific data. By understanding these factors, HR stakeholders can make informed decisions to reduce attrition rates and enhance overall employee retention.
